# BottledBackEnd

Overview
We designed an app that allows people all over the world to share their deepest darkest secrets with each other. And if you happen to really hit it off with the other person there is an option for you to meet up. We designed the app using a postgres sql database, golang for the backend, and android studio for the front end of our app bottled.
